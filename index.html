 <p>From the very begining the goal was to always deliver quality modest clothing at an affordable price. In this day and age you have to sell an arm and a leg just to buy ONE abaya. Thats when i decided someone needed to bring change and that change had to start with me.I poured thousands of my own money into this project and had to beg lots of people to believe in me. Today im glad to stay Dijas Essentials has milions of customers around the world. If i had been told this would happen a few years ago I would laugh in disbelief but by the grace of God I have been able to accomplish my goals.</p>
